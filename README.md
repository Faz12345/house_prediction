🏡 Housing Price Prediction using Regression & EDA
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting housing prices using regression algorithms. The goal is to understand how different features such as the number of rooms, location, area, and other attributes affect house prices.

We perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and then build a predictive machine learning model to estimate housing prices.
